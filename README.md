## ü™ê Introduction

Hi there, I'm a graduate of Software Engineering student from the University of Portsmouth.

I have primarily worked on web applications, including projects like my University Grade Calculator and Predictor ([found here](https://github.com/NikBit101/dcalc_ext)) and a Brand Sustainability Review app ([found here](https://github.com/wgw0/sustainabilitychecker)). 

But I also have experience in Python; with Artificial Intelligence, Nueral Network and Data Analysis.

Currently, I‚Äôm focused on pursuing a career in business consulting. Feel free to check out my LinkedIn for more about my background and projects!


## üíª Projects & üå± Open-Source

As I mentioned before, I primarily work on WebApps. Most of my projects can be viewed on my [portfolio webpage](https://wgw0.github.io/portfolio/) or on my GitHub profile. I aim to create projects that offer users valuable information that can make their lives easier or more rewarding.

I also enjoy contributing to **Open-Source Repositories** by reviewing pull requests and participating in collaborative projects. I've worked on creating pull requests for the open-sourced Twitter code, which have been reviewed and are still open; you can find them in my forked repository [here](https://github.com/wgw0/twitter-algorithm).

I‚Äôve also got experience in Python, working on projects involving AI, neural networks, and data analysis. I‚Äôve done some scripting with C#, handled databases and management with SQL, and explored other frameworks and development environments.
